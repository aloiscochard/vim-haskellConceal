" What Is This: Add some conceal operator for your haskell files
" File:         haskell.vim (conceal enhancement)
" Author:       Vincent Berthoux <twinside@gmail.com>
" Last Change:  2011-09-07
" Version:      1.3.2
" Require:
"   set nocompatible
"     somewhere on your .vimrc
"
"   Vim 7.3 or Vim compiled with conceal patch.
"   Use --with-features=big or huge in order to compile it in.
"
" Usage:
"   Drop this file in your
"       ~/.vim/after/syntax folder (Linux/MacOSX/BSD...)
"       ~/vimfiles/after/syntax folder (Windows)
"
"   For this script to work, you have to set the encoding
"   to utf-8 :set enc=utf-8
"
" Additional:
"     * if you want to avoid the loading, add the following
"       line in your .vimrc :
"        let g:no_haskell_conceal = 1
"  Changelog:
"   - 1.3.1: putting undefined in extra conceal, not appearing on windows
"   - 1.3: adding new arrow characters used by GHC in Unicode extension.
"   - 1.2: Fixing conceal level to be local (thx Erlend Hamberg)
"   - 1.1: Better handling of non utf-8 systems, and avoid some
"           concealing operations on windows on some fonts
"
if exists('g:no_haskell_conceal') || !has('conceal') || &enc != 'utf-8'
    finish
endif
